# GCP Provisioning Foundations

This repository includes modules to walk through provisioning services in GCP and in some cases, securing them. This is particularly helpful for CEs to provision services in the *Argolis* environment.

The repository is a community contribution, is deliberately detailed with sequential steps versus fully scripted, automated -> to provide an understanding of what is involved.

Primary audience: Data Analytics CEs
