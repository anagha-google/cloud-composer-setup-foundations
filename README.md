# GCP Provisioning Foundations for Data Analytics Endeavors

## About the Repository
This repository includes modules that walk through provisioning the foundational infrstracture and security requirements in GCP for Data Analytics projects, and in some cases, securing them. The repository also has a complementary repository that covers provisioning individual data services.

## Motivation and Audience

## Structure
The repository contains modules that are deliberately detailed with sequential steps (versus fully scripted, automated) to provide an understanding of what is involved.
